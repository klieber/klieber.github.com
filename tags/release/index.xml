      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been having a lot of discussions with analysts in my organization about how to version software using Maven and I&amp;rsquo;m finding there is a common misconception about what SNAPSHOT actually means. I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a good blog to send them that helps explain versioning in Maven but unfortunately everything I&amp;rsquo;ve found merely discusses version formats and not how to use them as you&amp;rsquo;re developing an application. So, I decided I would take a stab at it. I welcome any comments and constructive criticism that will help me improve this document, so please feel free.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
