+++
I began using the the [Jasmine Maven Plugin][1] in June of 2012 and was immediately impressed with how well it worked and how easy it made automating my test execution. Soon after I discovered [require.js][2] and decided to begin using it in my applications. I learned quickly however that the require.js support in the Jasmine Maven Plugin had quite a few issues and so I decided to try and help fix some of them.
<!--more-->
Fast-forward to January of this year and I found myself a maintainer of the plugin with full commit access and a huge list of issues (thank you [Justin Searls][3] for the opportunity). I've had a few goals for my first release:

*   don't break anything (still crossing my fingers on this one)
*   make spec runner templates more useful by providing more variables
*   merge the require.js specific code into the default code
*   make the behavior of the `jasmine:bdd` goal and the `jasmine:test` goal consistent
*   improve overall code quality and setup checks to monitor and measure code quality

I'm happy to say that version 1.3.1.0 is out and while only time will tell if I didn't break anything and improving code quality is ongoing, I am confident that I achieved my goals. For a full list of bug fixes and enhancements in 1.3.1.0 go [here][4]

Please check out the [new site][5] for information on usage of the plugin and post any [issues you find on github][6].

The [next release][7] is planned for a little over a month from now and will have some new exciting features including support for using [PhantomJS][8] rather than HtmlUnit for headless test execution.

Enjoy!
