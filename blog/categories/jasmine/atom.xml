    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I began using the the <a href="http://searls.github.com/jasmine-maven-plugin">Jasmine Maven Plugin</a> in June of 2012 and was immediately impressed with how well it worked and how easy it made automating my test execution. Soon after I discovered <a href="http://requirejs.org">require.js</a> and decided to begin using it in my applications. I learned quickly however that the require.js support in the Jasmine Maven Plugin had quite a few issues and so I decided to try and help fix some of them.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Fast-forward to January of this year and I found myself a maintainer of the plugin with full commit access and a huge list of issues (thank you <a href="http://about.me/searls">Justin Searls</a> for the opportunity). I&rsquo;ve had a few goals for my first release:</p>

<ul>
<li>don&rsquo;t break anything (still crossing my fingers on this one)</li>
<li>make spec runner templates more useful by providing more variables</li>
<li>merge the require.js specific code into the default code</li>
<li>make the behavior of the <code>jasmine:bdd</code> goal and the <code>jasmine:test</code> goal consistent</li>
<li>improve overall code quality and setup checks to monitor and measure code quality</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;m happy to say that version 1.3.1.0 is out and while only time will tell if I didn&rsquo;t break anything and improving code quality is ongoing, I am confident that I achieved my goals. For a full list of bug fixes and enhancements in 1.3.1.0 go <a href="http://searls.github.com/jasmine-maven-plugin/github-report.html">here</a></p>

<p>Please check out the <a href="http://searls.github.com/jasmine-maven-plugin/">new site</a> for information on usage of the plugin and post any <a href="https://github.com/searls/jasmine-maven-plugin/issues">issues you find on github</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/searls/jasmine-maven-plugin/issues?milestone=2">next release</a> is planned for a little over a month from now and will have some new exciting features including support for using <a href="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a> rather than HtmlUnit for headless test execution.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
