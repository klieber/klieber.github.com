This is just the dreaded first blog entry.  I don't really have anything to say at this point and I'm not even sure how I intend to use this blog yet.  I'm thinking I'll be posting things I learned how to do and how I did it.  Hopefully, others will find something I learn useful but I really just want a central location for my own references so I guess it will be interesting to see if anyone actually reads this.
